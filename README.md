# Battleship Game

I created this battleship game using only python.
It is not like the origional game battleships.
It was designed as more of a hide and seek type game.
The computer hides three ships in three random locations on a game grid
and the used has 15 bullets to find all of the ships

##  Help along the way
I recieved help from my mentor Anto Rodriguez, I also used the following websites for help:
[w3](https://www.w3schools.com/)
[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
[Python-tutor](http://pythontutor.com/)

### Bugs
I only really encountered one issue that I was unable to ressolve.
When the player wins the game they are awarded one extra bullet despite not needing one.
